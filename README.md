# Sonoff-POW
Library and First Project for Sonoff POW switch
The included libary is an enhanced version of the ITEAD.cc library

The library and the sketch reads the values from the Sonoff POW HLW8012 chip and calculates the respective Power, current, and oltage values. 
Only voltage or current reading can be chosen.

 The sketch connects to the iopappstory.com and loads the assigned firmware down. It also asks for the WiFi credentials. and it connects to Adafruit.io
 as an MQTT broker. Pleas include the credentials in the credentials.h file and place this file in the libraries folder

The explanation of the project is on YouTube:
